# OpenSBS

OpenSBS is a web-based open-source starship bridge simulator.

We started this project mainly to test our skill but also to try something different in the bridge simulators world.

After playing with both [Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator](https://artemisspaceshipbridge.com/) and [Empty Epsilon](http://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/), we got hooked and from there it was all downhill.

## Features

* **Single instance**: there is no need to install one copy of the game for every player; just start the game and use your favourite browser. 
* **Play in your browser**: the user interface is written in HTML5/CSS3 and [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics).
* **Websockets**: all client-server communications travel through websockets by using the [SignalR](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/signalr) library.
* **Multi-platform**: the game is written in C# on the .NET Core framework.
* **Modularity**: create your own ships, stations, modules and scenarios using the powerful C# language.
